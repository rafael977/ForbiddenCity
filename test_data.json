This was our first stop on a three week tour of Asia and my memories of the hotel are almost entirely positive.  The room was spacious and well furnished and the bed was comfy, though very firm as were all the mattresses we encountered throughout our trip.  We had an outstanding view of the Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo skyline from our balcony (room 907, btw) and also overlooked the Statue of Liberty, the Fuji TV building,and the entrance to Aqua City shopping mall.  We could clearly see Tokyo Tower and the Skytree.  This view was great, as it was lovely scenically while also being good for people watching.  There was a giant sign at the entrance to Aqua City that said \"Toys r Us\", which made the view enticing for our son. BTW, Aqua City is a 30 second walk from the hotel on a pedestrian-only walkway - plenty of shopping and restaurants, including a couple of handy convenience stores.\r\n\r\nThe hotel room was fitted with one of those amazing Japanese toilets that you hear so much about.  The shower (separate from the tub - hurray!) was amazing and the towels were plush and plentiful.  Hilton regulars will recognize the Roth toiletries. The lobby and public areas are really very well done and much nicer in person than I had expected - this is really a 5 star hotel.  As I have diamond status with Hilton we got access to the lounge and the pool area as well as breakfast in the lobby restaurant.  The lounge was great, albeit too crowded - we were turned away at happy hour, which I've never had happen before.  They did however call us a few minutes later to tell us a table had opened up, which was nice.  There are complementary adult beverages and lots of snack foods but certainly not really enough to call a meal, though truthfully we didn't eat anything else that night, so maybe it was enough.  Breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic - a nice mix of hot and cold Japanese and western foods, lots of pastries and cereals, and decent coffee.  The pool area is awesome...because it costs an arm and a leg to use if you don't have diamond status, it was generally pretty quiet, but the outdoor hot tub overlooking the bridge and skyline was fabulous and would be worth paying for.  Sitting there at night overlooking Tokyo after months of planning and hours of traveling is one of my fondest memories of the trip.  Very special.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of negatives during our stay.  Besides being turned away at the lounge, we had to wait an incredibly long time to be checked in.  Our car dropped us off at the front door at around 4pm and we were ushered to the upstairs lounge to check in, presumably because of my Honors status.  But we sat in the lounge for over an hour waiting to be checked in.  While it was nice looking out at Tokyo and having a relaxing beverage, after a 12 hour flight we just wanted to get to our room, take a shower and change clothes.  It was pretty frustrating to have to sit there waiting.  Also I was hoping for some sort of upgrade from the room I reserved, especially since I could see on the Hilton app that there were better rooms available, but no upgrades were offered.  Oh well - it was only one night and the room we had was pretty great anyway.  My last gripe - the hotel, like many in Tokyo, charges a significant and in my opinion egregious extra charge for a kid, something along the lines of 7000 yen.  Come on.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really liked the Hilton Odaiba and would definitely stay there again on future trips. Language was not a barrier at any time.  It's not the right hotel for a multi night tour of Tokyo as it is a bit outside the main city but Odaiba itself is an awesome place to get settled into Tokyo without being thrown into the chaos immediately (don't miss the Oedo Onsen in Odaiba!).  We used MK Taxi service from Narita to get to the hotel - took about 50 minutes and cost 183USD after conversion but well worth it as we went straight to the hotel in a beautiful Mercedes driven by a white-gloved driver.  For three people it was maybe double the cost of the Airport Limo bus but that bus only runs like every two hours to Odaiba and makes several stops.  We took a taxi to Tokyo Disney the next day for around $40 if I remember right.  I would not recommend using this hotel as a base for Disney.  There is a Hilton right on the Disney property that would be better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the couple of minor issues we encountered were vastly outweighed by the positives, and I highly recommend the Hilton Odaiba and look forward to returning some day!","lang":"en","canShrink":true,"owner_response":{"id":498704222,"text":"\"Thank you for your detailed review of your recent stay at the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba.

But the wait was made bearable by the friendly hostesses who brought us glasses of wine and kept us updated on our progress up the wait list.  \n\nEveryone in my group enjoyed their meals.  A tasty basket of bread came fast and was replenished when we devoured it like wolves.

In fact, everything about the hotel was fine, there was just nothing \"great\", except maybe for the service in the concierge lounge, which was really good.  A couple of hiccups during my stay - no one came around to pick up my shoes that I left outside my door for shining, and the water pressure in the shower was abysmal.  But the linens and bathroom accoutrements were nice, the bed was comfortable, and my 8th floor room was dead quiet, even though it was literally beside the elevators.  The wifi was solid - I worked from my room one day and never had any problems.  The gym is nice and has everything you might need for a good workout, including way more weight machines than a typical hotel gym.  The gym has towels and water bottles and apples and extra ear buds, always nice.  I only ate at the lounge and the food was good, especially the small desserts, but again nothing to \"wow\" you.  Alcoholic beverages in the lounge were not complementary, which they usually are not at Marriott properties. Harrumph. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would certainly stay at The Mayflower again but I will probably keep searching for my go-to DC hotel.

While it was probably the most expensive hotel I've ever paid for (over $700US per night) it was worth it for a once in a lifetime experience.  \n\nOur view over DisneySea was spectacular.  We watched Fantasmic from our room three nights in a row and saw the Easter show\u002Fboat parade several times as well.  The vantage point from our room was really special - we could see everything very clearly, and being up on the fourth floor gave us a view that no one inside the park has.  Amazing.  And the convenience of being inside the park was fabulous.  We could be back in our room in 5 minutes or back in the park in 5 minutes through a special entrance\u002Fexit in the park.\n\nThe room itself was nice.  Very well appointed and a great shower, as well as the great electronic Japanese toilet.  Not really $700 a night nice, but you're paying for location as much as anything.  Service is very good.  The cleaning people left towel animals in the shape of Duffy and Shellie Mae one night - super cute.  \n\nWe spent one night at the Tokyo Disneyland Hotel prior to the stay at the MiraCosta and I would say the TDL hotel is probably a shade \"nicer\" - room was bigger and better furnished, fancier lobby - but the MiraCosta wins for coolness and convenience.  My only complaint about the MiraCosta is that they failed to build enough balconies - that would really make these rooms amazing, and it would still fit in with the Italy aesthetic.  Oh well.  \n\nOne other thing I'd change is the booking process.  What a stressful thing that was.  I practiced for weeks, made phantom bookings, and learned some good tricks to getting a harbor room.  Because these rooms sell out almost immediately upon becoming available, you need to be ready by establishing an account, testing a credit card, and most importantly creating a browser bookmark for the days you need.  This will allow you to get through in the first few seconds when your night enters the 5 month booking window.  I wish I was kidding.\n\nAnyway, we thought this would be a once in a lifetime trip but we had such a great time we are already planning on returning the the MiraCosta in 2019.  It was that good.  I recommend the MiraCosta without hesitation.

The halls and room were kind of dark and the furniture and other accoutrements were not of the highest quality.  But again, for one night with the family and the dogs, it was fine.  Our room was huge and quiet and clean, so not much more really to ask for.  The service in the executive lounge at night was great, the woman there took great care of us.  There was enough food for us to make a meal out of it (though we took our son to Chick fil-a across the street) and we were able to put stuff in to-go containers to enjoy back at our room.  Breakfast in the lounge was also good though the selection was a little light - understandable since the hotel was practically empty.  \r\n\r\nOverall, we'd probably stay here again on an overnight drive,especially with the dogs in tow, but I wouldn't make this my first choice for an extended stay.

It's big and has some really great rides (Tron is one of my faves worldwide) but the place is very poorly run.  \n\nYou've already heard about the line cutting, trash, and kids peeing outside (all true, but all overblown and not that big a deal in my opinion) but the true travesty with this park is the lack of Disney charm and, more importantly, management oversight.  I can't believe Disney is allowing things to be run as poorly as they are here.  \n\nThe lines just to get in the park are insane -  the security line and the entry queues are epic.  But they don't need to be.  We were in Tokyo before Shanghai and those parks are pretty crowded but their security lines are virtually nonexistent and the tickets scan fast so people can flood into the park.  It took us a long time to get into the Shanghai park both days we went, probably about 90 minutes, and mostly due to slow security checks and a clunky ticket reading system. We were there right at opening time the first day (a Thursday) and an hour early the next day. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel (which was very nice but offered zero perks).\n\nOnce inside the park, things don't get better.  A third-party security company makes up about half of the staff rather than normal Disney cast members, and the security people are not friendly.  But they also don't do their jobs very well, as guys are selling fast passes and cutting lines right in front of them and they don't react.  \n\nWe bought the full slate of fast passes both days we were there and frankly if we hadn't we would have a had a truly rotten time  Wait times were hours long, and the queues for fast passes were no picnic either.  You buy the passes (which consist of a stack of 7 individual ride passes in a little plastic sleeve) just as you enter the park, immediately on the left side of Mickey Avenue.  It takes awhile to buy the passes since you have to deal with several stages of cast members, including one who takes your picture with your phone so you can show the photo of you buying the passes to the cast members and security guards manning the fast pass lines.  We had to show the photo every time we used the passes and sometimes more than once.  The first time we rode Tron I put my phone in the locker as directed and then was asked for the photo once we got in the fast pass line.  So I had to go back to get my phone out of the locker, which is not an easy thing to do.  When we used regular fast passes, we had to show our park tickets too, again sometimes more than once.  We only managed to get three or four regular fast passes over two days.  Sometimes they let me get passes for the whole group by myself and a couple times they told me I could only get one fast pass.  So the gist of it is that they are making it really hard to get and use fast passes but aren't doing anything about the touts selling the fast passes right out in the open.  Weird.  By the way, three fast pass sets cost $213 (US). Ouch, but totally worth it.\n\nThere are some redeeming features at Shanghai Disney.  Tron is awesome, especially if you sit in the very front.  Pirates is cool but I didn't think it was as great as advertised- too much reliance on screens rather than actual sets and effects.  Buzz is awesome - you can actually see where you're shooting!  Seven Dwarves, Soaring, and Roaring Rapids were all fun.  The ropes course was good fun too.  We really enjoyed the caramel popcorn and got a cool Mickey popcorn holder that would have been at home in Tokyo.  Otherwise though the food wasn't very good.  The castle is pretty impressive.  The fireworks shows were cancelled both nights we were there.\n\nBut really overall we didn't have a great time at Shanghai Disney.  We seriously considered not going the second day, but we did go and probably had a better time the second day since our expectations were tempered.  But we won't be back.  We're already considering a return to Tokyo and Hong Kong, but we're likely done with Shanghai, at least until a major shakeup happens.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview385376108":{"snippet":"Visited the Utz store after taking the tour of the factory down the street.

Our hotel room faced the park and had a nice view from the 5th floor but you're really too far from the park to truly enjoy the night time shows.  The furniture and everything was pretty high end - we loved the secret fireworks show built into the headboards.  My son's bed folded out of a hutch which he loved.  The bathroom was well outfitted.  \n\nWe did have a couple of quibbles with the hotel.  Why they built it so far from the park is beyond me. They should have taken a cue from Tokyo and made this hotel part of the park.  As it is you need to either walk for 15 minutes or take a slow boat.  It's a lovely trip but really exhausting after a day in the park, especially when it's 500 degrees outside.  And other than being kind of close to the park there are absolutely no perks to staying here - no early entry, no fast passes, no opportunity to buy fast passes, no avoiding entry queues, nothing.  Really too bad.   \n\nBut all in all the hotel is very nice, if expensive, and I recommend staying here if you still insist on going to Shanghai Disney after reading all of the negative reviews.  Be sure to buy the fast pass package when you enter the park or you'll not be riding many rides.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview432266653":{"snippet":"Two stars may not be really fair, but three stars is just too high...I judge places like District Ta...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"Two stars may not be really fair, but three stars ...","rating":2,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"432266653"},"pid":35955,"published":true,"type":"review","title":"Didn't like District Taco","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWyXvAkKWJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEdmXX333omWxdJtGSCyIiCQxMfQxMStIESnIQiTQficpaHSJB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g28970-d3355522-r432266653-District_Taco-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":0,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"27 Oct 2016","locationId":3355522,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"3355522"},"id":432266653,"isMobile":true,"text":"Two stars may not be really fair, but three stars is just too high...I judge places like District Taco on their carne asada burritos, the toppings, and the guacamole.

The carne asada was a bit on the chewy side and the meat to bean ratio was way too low.  I should have ordered \"no beans\" but I was distracted when I ordered, so my bad, but still, way too many beans.  Also, something in the burrito was exceedingly sour, maybe the guac - too much lime or something.  The Colorado salsa from the salsa bar was fantastic but couldn't save the sour, over-beaned burrito.  I have a feeling I may have just gotten unlucky or hit the place on a bad night, but I won't be back.

The furnishings are fine if maybe a little on the older side; there was a wooden box covering what appeared to be a 100 year old air conditioning unit, but the temperature control in the room was fine.  Bed was crazy comfortable.   A couple of quibbles - it took a very long time for the water to get hot in both the sink and shower but eventually it got plenty hot.  And the shower head was about a foot too low.  Elevators are small but efficient- I never had to wait long.\n\nThe concierge lounge is top notch.  The food at dinner time was enough to keep me from having to go out  - it was Salisbury steaks in a brown gravy, mac and cheese, and asparagus spears, along with a nice salad.  Perfect, as I arrived around 7pm and didn't want to go out. Breakfast also included a bunch of hot dishes along with the usual breads and yogurts. And the lounge is gigantic.  Sadly they serve Pepsi products and charge for alcohol, but overall this lounge was way nicer than the one at the JW Marriott I stayed at in DC the week before.\n\nWifi was decent (I had a couple pauses while FaceTimeing but not too bad) and the TV is small but offers Netflix (and maybe Hulu and Crackle if I remember) channels. They have the NFL Network too.  \n\nOverall I was very satisfied with the Marriott East Side and will surely consider staying there again in the future.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview400884622":{"snippet":"I know that in Paris, Paul gets a little bit of a bad rap mostly because it's a chain, but when I wa...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"I know that in Paris, Paul gets a little bit of a ...","rating":5,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"400884622"},"pid":0,"published":true,"type":"review","title":"Great taste of Paris in DC","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWyXvAkKWJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEdKKvvd3XXWxdJtGSCyIiCQxMfQxMStIESnIQiTQficpaHSJB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g28970-d2205687-r400884622-Paul-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":1,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"3 Aug 2016","locationId":2205687,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"2205687"},"id":400884622,"isMobile":false,"text":"I know that in Paris, Paul gets a little bit of a bad rap mostly because it's a chain, but when I was last in Paris I ate and\u002For drank coffee at Paul every day as it was next to my hotel, and I loved it.

But there were some issues with my stay that are worth mentioning. \n\nFirst, the room.  I had a two room suite on the 14th floor.  I had reserved a Steinbeck suite but the hotel had no record of my reservation, even though I was looking right at the reservation on the Hilton app on my phone as I stood there.  A manager had to be called and she created a new reservation for me using the info on my phone - luckily they weren't full or I don't know what would have happened.  Apparently there is some issue with reservations made via the app, so beware.\n\nSo I was given what I think their site calls an \"artists suite\" rather than the Steinbeck suite. The room was awesome.  Creaky hardwood floors, great decor and artwork, and a lot of room for one person.  I had a nice view of the Empire State Building, though the windows were VERY dirty.  I really can't say enough about the room, it was very cool. The bed was comfortable and the street noise was faint.  The bathroom was very small and I was disappointed to have a tub instead of a shower.  But the water pressure was good and there was no shortage of hot water.  They have pump-style toiletries in the shower - sadly my tub was supplied with two shower gels and one conditioner.  Despite repeated requests for shampoo, they never replaced one of the gels with shampoo.  Disappointing.  My hair looked crazier than usual for two days since I washed it with shower gel.  Sigh.  And there was virtually nowhere to put your own toiletry bag - a narrow glass shelf over the toilet and an inconvenient shelf under the sink were the only choices.\n\nBreakfast in the hotel restaurant was enjoyable.  Hilton gold and diamond members can choose three of four things off the menu - yogurt w\u002Fgranola, oatmeal w\u002Fapples and cinnamon, waffles, or a pastry (croissant, pain au chocolate, or blueberry muffin).  Each morning I ordered two of the first three and had the pastry wrapped up to go.  The waffle was fantastic, the oatmeal was nice with the apples, but the yogurt was the plain, unsweetened bitter kind.  The pastries were good.  And the coffee was great.  Service was pretty fast - it's full service sit down, not a buffet or grab n go.\n\nIn addition to the dirty windows and lack of shampoo, there were a couple of other minor issues during my stay.  The toilet seat was coming loose from the toilet (this was fixed) and the light fixture in the bedroom didn't work - though I think this was operator error as I didn't realize there was a master switch near the front door that controlled the bedroom light.  At night the whole hotel smells like cooked meat from the restaurant.  I mean the whole hotel.  I didn't mind the smell but I could totally see it bothering some people.  And lastly the gym is pretty sad - two treadmills, an elliptical, and a bike along with some dumbbells, all in an area smaller than my room.  \n\nDespite my list of issues, I really liked the Renwick overall and would definitely stay there again in the future.  It has a lot of character (albeit some of the artsy stuff feels a little forced) and is much more interesting than the typical Hilton and like properties in and around Times Square.  I loved my suite and the furnishings. Hopefully though next time I'll be able to wash my hair!\n\n\n","lang":"en","canShrink":true,"owner_response":{"id":472224116,"text":"\"Thank you so much for your very detailed feedback about your recent stay at the Renwick Hotel!

The carpet seemed new and the furniture was nice; the bed was comfy, the tv and clock were good, there were lots of power outlets and the wifi was strong.  The bathroom was very nice - two sinks were separate from the toilet and shower which is always good.  The walk-in shower was great, I hate showering in a bathtub.  And they put the shampoo and body wash in the shower - hallelujah!  Why every hotel doesn't do this I don't know. \n\nThe grounds of the hotel are amazing.  I was there during the baseball winter meetings and that event dominated the hotel, which was fine with me.  Saw lots of baseball players, management and media.  The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas, and also had baseball stuff and TV sets everywhere.  I had drinks in the sports bar and up on the roof at the rooftop bar and both were nice though on the resort-expensive side.  Be sure to check out the coupons they give you at check in for some highly discounted drinks!  The gym is as good as it gets at a hotel and the pool is gigantic.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my stay at the Gaylord and recommend it highly.  Just wish it was closer to DC - traffic is tremendous so it took 30-45 minutes each way to and from the White House.  Plus with the MGM opening up the road it's only going to get worse.  Uber into DC was about $20, taxi closer to $30.  But most people aren't staying here for business in DC.  If you don't need to go to DC, you are in easy walking distance to dozens of bars and restaurants if you don't want to eat at the hotel.

We loved the hotel, it was perfect for our needs.\n\nThere are fancier hotels in Beijing but you can hardly get more bang for your buck than the Imperial Mansion.  Our room (an \"Executive one bedroom\") was essentially a one bedroom apartment, probably about 1,000 square feet.  We had a king bedroom plus an additional room with a fold out sofa bed for the boy - there were large sliding panels that enabled us to close that room off so it was like having two bedrooms.  There were two full bathrooms.  The king room had a large walk in closet and the master bath had a great rainfall shower and gigantic garden tub, complete with TV in the mirror. The other bathroom had a shower stall but I don't think we used it.  The room had standard Marriott bathroom amenities like soap and shampoo but also had robes and slippers.  Housekeeping could be more thorough, lots of fingerprints and things like that but the room was certainly clean enough.  The a\u002Fc was effective.\n\nOur room had a full kitchen with silverware and plates and bowls and whatnot but we didn't really use any of that.  What we did use and what really made this room valuable was the washer\u002Fdryer...we were in the middle of a three week Asia trip and the ability to wash clothes was a lifesaver.  Yeah, the dryer was slow but we were able to do a load during the day and one at night and got everything we had washed.  Nice.\n\nBreakfast was included and was not a highlight.  There was plenty of variety of hot and cold food but it wasn't very good. Service at breakfast also wasn't very good. There is bread and cereal for the unadventurous but the hot western food like eggs and bacon all tasted a little bit off.  We ordered drinking water through the hotel's shopping service and were very surprised to have a gigantic 5 gallon jug delivered to the room.  There is no dispenser so it was very hard to use but we drank maybe half of it.\n\nThe pool is amazing, one of the largest indoor hotel pools I've ever seen.  There are locker rooms for changing.  You have to wear a swim cap so make sure to bring one if you plan to use the pool.  They strictly enforce this rule so be warned.\n\nFor a tourist the location of this hotel simply can't be beat - around the corner from Wangfujing shopping street and one of the food streets with the scorpions on a stick and whatnot.  A couple of giant western type malls are very nearby.  We even found a Dunkin Donuts within 5 minutes of the hotel (in the APM mall I think it was called).  Tiananmen Square and the a forbidden city are not far away.

Spent two nights there on a recent tour of Asia and wish I had spent more time here.  I've been fortunate to stay at some pretty great hotels in my travels and not too many were as good as this Conrad.  While we were checking in we realized what a place this was - fabulous view and truly amazing restrooms in the lobby.  Great start.  \n\nWe were upgraded to a suite with a bay view which was amazing; lots of space and a great view.  The bathroom was terrific - the shower (and crazy Japanese toilet) was as good as it gets.  The club lounge was among the best I've ever experienced.  Complementary adult beverages and snacks at night, including ice cream sundaes, which I'm not sure I've ever had in a hotel lounge before.  Service was over the top too, constantly refilling champagne glasses and whatnot.  The outdoor pool was also very nice.  \n\nBreakfast was great in the lounge, and on our second day they allowed us to have complimentary room service because we had an early plane to catch.  The ladies in the lounge took our order the night before and the food was delivered as requested, on time and as ordered.   This is the kind of thing that makes you really appreciate staying at a truly great hotel.  Well done, Conrad!  \n\nI am trying to think of a negative, and the only thing I can think of is that the location leaves a little to be desired.  We had a ridiculous time trying to get to the hotel from the Hamarikyu gardens, which are right next door but separated by roadways.  But the Conrad is very close to two subway stations that are kind of easy to navigate and also walking distance from Ginza.  \n\nAll in all, the Conrad Tokyo is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.

It doesn't compete on pure number of attractions, but it is the most detailed, beautifully themed park, with gorgeous architecture and friendly helpful staff (umm, cast members). Every corner you turn there is another vista that has you grabbing for your camera.  The park really is stunning. \r\n\r\nAdvanced planning is vital to enjoying Disneysea.  Get there early, like at least an hour before opening.  Don't go on a weekend or Japanese holiday.  If at all possible stay at the Mira Costa hotel on the property - besides being an amazing hotel inside the actual park, it allows you to enter the park 15 minutes before everyone else.  This may seem comical compared to the hour granted in the US parks, but the Happy 15 as it is called really gives you a tremendous advantage in riding a couple attractions and getting early fast passes.  \r\n\r\nTwo days is really needed to help you envelope yourself in the aura of the park and to enjoy everything at a reasonable pace.  In our two days in late May we were able to ride the headliners several times each without ever waiting longer than 30 minutes in line thanks to advance planning, the happy 15, and efficient fast pass usage.  Don't miss Journey to the Center of the Earth, Tower of Terror (different and better back story than the Twilight Zone theme in Orlando), Indiana Jones, Raging Spirits, and Sinbad.  Make sure to try the popcorn - we had two servings each of milk chocolate and caramel and it was addicting and the best popcorn I've ever had.  Not sure how they keep it so crisp with the tasty flavorings.  And everyone will be carrying a popcorn case - by the end you will be too!  We got an awesome BB8 one and it is as cute as can be.  We also tried a bunch of the snack items like the gyoza dog, the Chandu tail, the Alien matchi dumplings, and a few others- all very unusual, eye catching, and delicious.  Plan to also come home with some \"kawaii\" (cute) merchandise like a Duffy bear or Gelatoni cat.  Along with popcorn cases you'll notice every local carrying a Duffy or one of Duffys friends or a Duffy ticket holder around their neck.  I've never seen dedication like this anywhere else.  \r\n\r\nAs for shows, definitely make time for the Big Band Beat stage show - again hands down the best Disney show I've seen.  If you don't win the lottery for seats (yep) you can stand by for the first show for good seats or for any show if you don't mind the balcony.  As for the parades\u002Fshows on the water, we were able to watch them from the comfort of our room at the Mira Costa - truly magical, particularly since we were up on the fourth floor, so we had an astounding view of everything.  The Mira Costa is not a discount hotel, but it is quite worth it if you can swing it.\r\n\r\nOverall, Disneysea met and exceeded my high expectations.  I can't wait to return some day.  It truly is the best Disney park on earth.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview432424160":{"snippet":"I enjoyed my meal at Kabuki.

We followed our stay here with three nights at the MiraCosta, and while that hotel is amazing and right in DisneySea, the Disneyland Hotel is arguably the nicer hotel, and is certainly cheaper and easier to book. The lobby is impressive and features soaring ceilings and pretty low key Disney-fication.  You know this is a 5 star hotel the moment you walk in.  \r\n\r\nOur room was large and had an amazing view of the Disney Resort.  Having a balcony was very cool, although the fireworks were cancelled our one night there, which was a disappointment because we planned to watch them from the balcony.  The furniture and toiletries are top notch, and the bathroom was fantastic  Don't forget to take the fancy shopping bag in the closet like we did!  Free souvenir!  Plus a little cup and toothbrushes and whatnot are free for the taking.\r\n\r\nThe Disneyland Hotel is almost as convenient to Disneyland as the MiraCosta is to DisneySea; you're right outside the gates.  We paid less for our concierge level room that included a nice breakfast in the lobby restaurant than we did for our Harbor view room at the MiraCosta that came with nothing (but had an amazing view).  The concierge lounge (the Marceline Salon as it is known) is nothing to write home about - it's beautiful and you can grab a beer in the evening and maybe a handful of snacks but really it's not much of a lounge, as there is no meal or anything like that presented there (as I said you get breakfast in the Dreamer's Lounge in the lobby, which is spectacular).  We spent a lot of time in the lounge because it took us FOREVER to get checked in.  Like around an hour.  That was the only negative of our stay here.  \r\n\r\nIf you are in a quandary about which hotel to stay in, well - both the MiraCosta and the Disneyland Hotel have much to recommend them.  If you are going to both parks you should consider a split stay like we did so you can see both of these amazing hotels.  They make it very simple to transfer and your bags will be waiting for you in the new room.  We plan to return to Tokyo in 2019 and will likely only visit DisneySea this time, and we are likely to choose the MIraCosta just because of the location.  But the Disneyland Hotel is still pretty convenient to DisneySea, so don't rule it out.  \r\n\r\nI would also recommend any of the Disney Hotels over the non-Disney ones if your budget allows and if your main priorities are a nice hotel and getting extra value out of the parks - the convenience and the Happy 15 minutes that you get in early to the parks is truly worth the extra money, especially if you expect this to be a once-in-a-lifetime thing like we thought it would be for us (but we had such a great time we're going back!)  Those 15 minutes probably enable you to ride an extra 3-4 headliners each day since you get a jump on the crowds and a head start on the fast passes.  We rode Toy Story Mania twice in the first hour one day thanks to the Happy 15 (by grabbing a fast pass then riding it immediately upon entry), and without it we probably wouldn't have ridden it all. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the Disneyland Hotel in Tokyo is a great hotel and it's unlikely you'll be disappointed staying there.  We loved it.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview514350972":{"snippet":"The St. Regis is a gorgeous hotel with fantastic service in a virtually perfect location in D.C.

I was given lots of bottled water but I don't know if that is because of my SPG status or what.

It's a full service sit down kind of thing and doesn't open until 7am so early risers and those in a big hurry needn't bother.  No question though that they would probably cobble something together to go for you if needed.  But do try to sit down for the meal, it's nice. And the restaurant itself is beautiful.  Lastly, try to make the 6pm champagne sabering- lots of fun and a little bit of free champagne to boot.  It only lasts for like 5 minutes so get there early.\n\nA couple of minor quibbles - the \"St. Regis Athletic Club\" is an hysterical name for a pretty sad little hotel gym.  There's a couple treadmills, a bike and an elliptical along with some dumbbells in a space smaller than my room.  Egads.  In the hotel's defense, the room saw little use (I was the only one in there three out of four visits) but still.  The equipment is nice but isn't connected so the \"web\" and other features don't work.  Also, the hotel does not seem to abide by the Starwood \"best room available\" perk for Platinum guests. They claimed at checkin that I had been upgraded but really all I got was a slightly better view.  Looking at the website I could see there were several better rooms available but I didn't complain. But I shouldn't have needed to.\n\nAll in all this is a great hotel and I won't hesitate to return.  One of my faves in DC for sure.

We purchased 2 all-day passes for $29.99 each using a Valpak coupon we found on-line; me and my son raced on the go-cart tracks dozens of times and my wife, who didn't buy a ticket, was still allowed to race a couple of times because the place was not busy at all.  No lines (on an August Friday morning\u002Fafternoon), no waiting to race, and nice long races (often we'd go 10-15 laps without stopping) made the day that much more fun.  There are two one-man cart tracks that are fun and twisty and one giant oval that features two-man carts.  There is a loosely-enforced 60in or so height requirement for the 2-man carts (my son is about 57in tall but was allowed to drive), but that track is boring anyway, the twisty tracks were much more fun.  The cars don't go incredibly fast but they're still quite fun, especially for the 10-13 year old crowd that seems to be the main target audience.   The workers seemed a little disinterested in their jobs but did a good job straightening things out when there were accidents (which usually involved two kids spinning each other out and one of them ending up facing the wrong way - there's no reverse on these carts).  They were certainly not interested in enforcing the \"no bumping\" rule which gets mentioned at the start of every race but for the most part the kids policed themselves.  It was fun to spin a kid into the wall after he bumped me and my son repeatedly - he stopped bumping us after that.  \r\n\r\nThe mini golf course is fun if you're playing for \"free\" (as we kinda were since we bought the all-day pass for the go carts). Otherwise don't bother. The holes are in terrible shape and one was even borderline unplayable, with wrinkles and tears in the carpet preventing straight-on shots from going near the hole.  But we had 4 holes-in-one between the two of us, which is fun no matter how easy or messed up a hole is.   My son also did the bungee trampoline thing but it seemed that the kid who strapped him in put the cords too tight because my son was barely able to bounce off the trampolines.  Lastly the boy also did the spider tower climbing contraption - this thing is pretty sad and a little dangerous, as the outer structure is made of iron beams and more than one kid I saw complained of bashing their head or other body parts on the hard metal frame. Not fun. \r\n\r\nBut overall you come here for the go carts, and they are lots of fun.  We'll probably be back.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview469839245":{"snippet":"This hotel is in an OK location for DC - kinda far from the real tourist stuff and not all that conv...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"This hotel is in an OK location for DC - kinda far...","rating":4,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"469839245"},"pid":0,"published":true,"type":"review","title":"Good enough!","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWyXvAkKWJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEd3AvmAXdoWxdJtGSCyIiCQxMfQxMStIESnIQiTQficpaHSJB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g28970-d84101-r469839245-Renaissance_Washington_DC_Dupont_Circle_Hotel-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":1,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"24 Mar 2017","locationId":84101,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"84101"},"id":469839245,"isMobile":false,"text":"This hotel is in an OK location for DC - kinda far from the real tourist stuff and not all that convenient to the metro, but still not THAT far from things either if you don't mind a decent walk.  The hotel seems to be trying very hard to be like the W brand, but isn't quite there yet.  They play louder-than-normal music in the lobby and have a bit of a light show in the elevator bank, but the rooms are pretty traditional.  My room was an upgraded king room and was oddly laid out, with strange dead spaces on either side of the window and a completely out of place bar sink in the middle of the room.  The fridge was on the floor in one of the dead spaces, across the room from the sink.  Just plain strange.  But very large, and the bed was comfortable, so the room overall was fine.  What lifts this hotel from the 3 star range to 4 stars for me was the club lounge.  The food in the evening was limited but for me was enough to constitute dinner both nights I stayed there.  Breakfast was good and filling as well, with a few hot and cold options.  Unlike most hotels, the lounge was not particularly crowded, which was nice.  \r\n\r\nOverall my impressions of the Renaissance Dupont Circle are positive.  It won't be my first choice on return trips to DC, but it won't be that far down the list either.  A solid 3.5 star property, rounding up to 4 stars for the lounge.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview495994385":{"snippet":"Went to the Oedo Onsen in early June 2017 with my wife and 11 year old son.

What a great and relaxing way to spend a few hours our first day in Tokyo!  Leave your inhibitions at the door and have a great time.  There are plenty of reviews that describe how the place works, so I won't get too into that, but I will say that our day here was one of the highlights of our three weeks in Japan and China.  What you need to do as you enter will become obvious and there are folks out front to guide you if you're confused, so don't be too intimidated.  Remember to keep your underwear on when you change into your yukata (robe) - you remove it when you actually go into the baths.  And don't be too self conscious - no one cares how big or small or hairy or whatever you are.  Just make sure to cover tattoos before you get there because if you have them they won't let you in.\r\n\r\nWe tried a little bit of everything.  The foot bath\u002Fwalk was interesting but very painful. We thoroughly enjoyed the area where the fish nibble on your feet - it was weird but fun and our feet felt amazing when we were done. There's an extra charge but the experience is worth it. The food in the common area is decent and allowed me and my family to try different things without spending a million dollars.  And there's beer!  The baths themselves, where the genders are segregated, were very relaxing and fun once we got used to the whole being naked in front of strangers thing.  I'm still not sure what the little orange towel was for (they give you that and a full size towel which is not to be brought into the baths) but I enjoyed wearing it on my head like the locals did, for whatever purpose that was. We soaped up and showered afterward and felt like a million bucks, all polished and clean. The locker room provided hair products and sterile combs and brushes, which was appreciated. After the baths we played some games, threw some throwing stars, did some shopping, and just lounged around.  \r\n\r\nOverall we spent about three or four hours in the Oedo Onsen and spent about $120 (US) for the three of us including the fish nibbling and food and drink.  Absolutely worth it and highly recommended for the onsen novice and Americans visiting Tokyo for the first time.

We had Jessie of Tours by Jessie (highly recommended) show us around Beijing for two days and her accompanying us through the Forbidden City was invaluable.  Without a guide, the area is just a series of Chinese buildings and whatnot; with a guide you get in depth info on everything you might be interested in.  Your kids can ask silly but practical questions.  You'll learn the significance of the dragon statues and animals on the corners of the roofs of the buildings; who lived where and when etc. etc.  She also knew where the restrooms and snack bars were, no small thing.\r\n\r\nWe spent about two or three hours walking through the Forbidden City and gardens.  I can't say it was fun, but it was interesting and informative and our son seemed to get something out of it.  When we got home it was interesting to watch the movie The Last Emperor because it takes place mostly in the Forbidden City and it brought it to life a little for us.  \r\n\r\nAll in all the Forbidden City is an obvious must do attraction in Beijing. But the average person will get much more out of it by hiring a guide.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview497272282":{"snippet":"Me, my wife and our 11 year old son spent a day with Amy in June 2017 and she was the ultimate tour ...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"Me, my wife and our 11 year old son spent a day wi...","rating":5,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"497272282"},"pid":459,"media":[{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMedia","$i":"263811217"},{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMedia","$i":"263810915"}],"published":true,"type":"review","title":"Look no further if you're contemplating hiring a guide in Hong Kong!","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWyXAdXUkWJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEdAkXkXXvXW5iCyQxbiCyB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g294217-d3262867-r497272282-Hong_Kong_Greeters-Hong_Kong.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":3,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"29 Jun 2017","locationId":3262867,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"3262867"},"id":497272282,"isMobile":false,"text":"Me, my wife and our 11 year old son spent a day with Amy in June 2017 and she was the ultimate tour guide.

Even if you think you don't need a tour guide, you're better off with Amy than striking it out on your own, especially if you're new to the city.  From the get go Amy was a huge help - we were on the fence as to whether we wanted to hire a guide or go it alone in Hong Kong and our initial emails with Amy convinced us going with her was the wise move.  She suggested an itinerary that included places we weren't considering, such as a Wan Chai wet market and Toy Street, which ended up being my son's two favorite parts of the itinerary.  Amy was very flexible and added some things to the itinerary at our request and made some wise suggestions as to what we should do the night before the tour without her; she also met us early at our hotel so we could get to the Peak before the crowds, which was especially important since we were touring on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nAmy is very personable and provides her clients with benefits like front of the line privileges at tourist attractions and a very thorough knowledge of the subway system - we never would have been able to visit as many attractions in one day without her.  It was fun to use nothing but public transport - on our private tours in Shanghai and Beijing our guides had vans to take us around, but using buses and the subway very much added to the overall Hong Kong experience.  Amy knew exactly where to go for connections and which exits to take - very helpful!  We also ate at a popular and iconic dim sum spot (Maxim's) that we probably wouldn't have chosen on our own, but I am so glad we ate there.  \r\n\r\nOverall, Amy well-deserves her 5 star rating on TripAdvisor and we were very happy we hired her to take us around. She is very knowledgeable of HK history and current events and speaks pretty good English. :)   When we return we are likely to hire her again for sure -  thanks Amy for a very memorable day!","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview385370980":{"snippet":"My family and I are maybe a little weird but we tend to really enjoy factory tours.

Pooh's Honey Hunt was great but was broken a lot of the day so we could only ride it once.  Monsters Inc we found to be overrated, really nothing special.  But the usual rides like Haunted Mansion, Pirates, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder, etc, were all wonderfully themed and fun.  Lines were manageable in the middle of the week but fast passes helped a lot. Very sadly both Space Mountain and Small World were closed during our visit.  Boo.

Inside, our standard two-queen room was nicely decorated and had everything you might need.  The room had quality linens with Kisses subtlety embossed on the sheets, and all of the toiletries were chocolate scented.  Room had a handy mini fridge. \n\nThe new water park is great - smallish but fun and clean, with an activity room and arcade to boot.  My 10yr old son loved it.  There is also a snack bar that serves adult beverages, so I loved it too, though the drinks are resort-priced.  The hot tub is enormous and clean and perfectly heated.  \n\nThe lobby is very nice and the restaurants looked good though we didn't eat at them.  My son did the kids check-in and got a lanyard plus he won the guess-how-many-kisses-in-the-jar contest and got a giant Hershey kiss as the prize.  Fun!  There were s'more cookouts at night and characters occasionally roamed the lobby for photo ops.  We got full size Hershey bars at check in and kisses after our room was serviced but other than that it wasn't really the free flowing chocolate fest we were half expecting.  No bowls of Hershey miniatures or kisses all over the hotel.  Rats.  We didn't use the transportation system to the park and never do anywhere we go. We prefer to be in control of our comings and goings.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the lodge but I don't know if we'd pay the surcharge to stay there again. I travel a lot and have bunches of hotel points that would allow us to stay free at hotels nearby of similar quality with breakfast included as well.  The extra early hour at Hershey Park was not that great of a benefit for us as the park was not crowded when we were there anyway.  But I don't regret staying at the Lodge for our first stay at Hershey Park - it was fun and helped prolong the overall feeling of the Hershey Park experience.

This was a great way to ease into the culture shock of travelling half way around the world to Tokyo.  Lots to see and do without the potentially intimidating crowds and hubbub of Tokyo proper.  Awesome views of the city and the Rainbow bridge.  The multiple malls and entertainment complexes can keep anyone, from couples to families to solo travelers, busy for days.  We spent several hours walking from complex to complex and also spent half a day at the Oedo Onsen (geothermal baths - also highly recommended), which was really special. There's a public beach, river cruise pier, large ferris wheel, video game emporiums, Legoland adventure park, Toyota showcase, Fuji TV tours, and tons of shopping, drinking, and dining venues.  Aqua City has a Disney Store as well as various souvenir and clothing stores.  There's a pet store that sells $7,000 (USD) puppies and there's also a Toys R Us.  It's all kind of manufactured and sanitized but it's also lots of good clean fun.  And most of the walking is on convenient and safe pedestrian-only walkways.  I will definitely return if I ever make it back to Tokyo.","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview494978234":{"snippet":"Me, my wife, and our 11 year old son spent two amazing days with Jessie in Beijing in early June 201...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"Me, my wife, and our 11 year old son spent two ama...","rating":5,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"494978234"},"pid":459,"media":[{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMedia","$i":"262447431"}],"published":true,"type":"review","title":"If you're going to Beijing, do a tour with Jessie!!!","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWyXAdXUXWJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEdAdAkvXmdW7VSOSCyB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g294212-d2145605-r494978234-Beijing_Private_Tours_By_Jessie-Beijing.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":0,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"21 Jun 2017","locationId":2145605,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"2145605"},"id":494978234,"isMobile":false,"text":"Me, my wife, and our 11 year old son spent two amazing days with Jessie in Beijing in early June 2017.  She was absolutely perfect for us.  Her driver was at the airport waiting for us with a sign and he took us to our hotel without any issues and in a very comfy passenger van.  The following two days Jessie and her driver met us in the lobby of our hotel and took us on several adventures, including the Wall at Mutianyu, the Olympic area, the Forbidden City, etc., etc.  Jessie is chock full of information and maintains enthusiasm for the places visited even though she's been to all of them a million times.  Kudos for that!  She also always had answers for our questions about Chinese history, current affairs, and interesting stuff like school holidays, how hard it is to get license plate for your car, or how to use the free bike system.  She was honest and didn't whitewash anything, and offered to take a lot of family photos for us.  Oh and she was great with our son and her English is wonderful! \r\n\r\nJessie's coordination with the driver was fantastic - he was always there when we were done visiting a site so that we never were left waiting for the van to arrive, even though we often ended up far away from where we started.  Lastly, Jessie was very flexible with the itinerary; we started very early the first day so that there were no crowds at the Great wall, and when we were ahead of schedule the second day she added a trip to a hutong area that was very cool and which actually ended up being one of the highlights of the tour. All in all we had an amazing time and cannot recommend Jessie enough.  If we ever return to Beijing Jessie will be the first person we contact for another tour, and she should be your first call too!  Thanks Jessie for a great couple of days!","lang":"en","canShrink":true},"UserReview442886489":{"snippet":"You already know what you're going to get here - expensive beer and middling bar food at high prices...","author":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONMember","$i":"rbpjt2soKDc="},"smallerSnippet":"You already know what you're going to get here - e...","rating":4,"pointBreakdown":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONPointBreakdown","$i":"442886489"},"pid":35955,"published":true,"type":"review","title":"Decent sports bar with resort prices","helpfulVoteUrl":"LeJIVqdWykkAUXk3WJQEJIVqiJcpVYUWJQpSMYokdUXdvWEddXvv3dvAWZJISiCJcQ5JEHiEQDJEgcJCMB","url":"\u002FShowUserReviews-g7791276-d1176152-r442886489-National_Pastime_Sports_Bar_and_Grill-National_Harbor_Maryland.html","showingSmallerSnippet":true,"helpfulVotes":1,"isTablet":false,"formattedDate":"8 Dec 2016","locationId":1176152,"location":{"$t":"modules.unimplemented.entity.JSONLocation","$i":"1176152"},"id":442886489,"isMobile":true,"text":"You already know what you're going to get here - expensive beer and middling bar food at high prices.

Charming and cozy while still having modern amenities, and easy walking distance to LL Bean and the rest of the shopping district in Freeport.  Maybe not as quaint (i.e., small) as other New England B&amp;B's or inns, and it is set on a pretty busy road, but overall the Harraseeket delivers a great experience.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I ditched the kid for a night and headed up to Freeport to stay at the Harraseeket, taking advantage of the Fireside package the night after Christmas.  The Fireside package was truly amazing - very, very highly recommended.  Our room was a large king with a fireplace and an awesome bathroom (if you look at their website and click on the Deluxe King with Fireplace, the picture is of the room we stayed in).  The fireplace was well stocked and already set up for a fire - we ended up using an entire basket full of wood and kindling and had a fire blazing all evening long.  The Fireside package also included a bottle of wine, a basket of fruit\u002Fcheese\u002Fcrackers, afternoon tea, dinner in the main restaurant, and breakfast in the morning.  All of it was fantastic.  The dinner truly stood out - we could order anything off the menu (and did!) and had an extraordinary meal, all included in our room rate (except the tip and alcohol, of course).  We shared a seafood appetizer, and my wife had the lobster (which the chef pulled out of the shell - hurray!!!) while I had the filet mignon and added a lobster tail.  We had two desserts which were delicious but we couldn't finish them after everything else we had eaten. Breakfast (a buffet) was also top notch - lots of Maine blueberries!  \r\n\r\nOverall, our short stay could not have been better.  We loved every minute of it and are already trying to figure out when we can make it back.  We would definitely get the Fireside package again - the price might seem a little high but in the end it is a tremendous value for what you get.  Don't make the mistake of staying somewhere else in Freeport if you are looking for a romantic getaway!\r\n\r\nA couple of FYIs:  there is plenty of parking in the back of the inn, but you might have a bit of a walk to get back to the inn.  There is a very nice indoor pool available, and the Broad Arrow Tavern is great fun.  Our room had a really nice bathroom with top shelf linens and toiletries.  The bed was very comfortable, and our room had a refrigerator and a modern flat screen TV.  We faced the road but did not have any trouble sleeping - the room was dead quiet. There is an elevator available.  Afternoon tea gets quite crowded so be sure to try to show up early.","lang":"en","canShrink":true,"owner_response":{"id":457323205,"text":"\"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us!
